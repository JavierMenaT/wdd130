        UNESCO Global Geoparks are unique, unified geographic areas in which sites and landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection, education and sustainable development. A UNESCO Global Geopark uses its geological heritage, in connection with all other aspects of the natural and cultural heritage of the area, to improve awareness and understanding of key issues facing society, such as sustainable use of natural resources, mitigating the effects of climate change and reducing risks related to natural disasters.
      </p>

        Imbabura is a duly delimited territory, which has a remarkable geological heritage, where lakes and volcanoes, moors, valleys, waterfalls converge; that is, with the rest of the natural heritage and is strengthened by the entire cultural and artisanal landscape of its people.
      </p>   
      <p>
        The territory of Imbabura was declared a UNESCO Global Geopark on April 17, 2019, after a rigorous process of characterization, documentation, dissemination and evaluation. It is essentially distinguished by its geological characteristics. Volcanic complexes such as Imbabura, Mojanda, Cotacachi - Cuicocha and Chachimbiro converge here; with lakes and lagoons, practically in all the cantons; waterfalls, water sources, different climatic floors and geomorphological attractions. This heritage is strengthened and made more attractive by its complementarity with ethnic, cultural and productive diversity.

        The Cotacachi - Cuicocha Volcanic Complex is located 10 km from Cotacachi and 13 km from Otavalo. It is part of the volcanic front located in the northern western cordillera of Ecuador. The area of its base is approximately 268 km2. It consists of four eruptive centers located around the main center Cotacachi (4939 masl), and correspond to: Muyurcu, Loma Negra, Peribuela and Cuicocha ordered from the oldest to the youngest respectively. The activity of this complex extends from 0.6 million years ago and its most recent activity occurred 2900 years before the present.

        Around the volcanic caldera we have the Gorki Campusano trail that has 12.5 kilometers of trail with medium to high difficulty and approximately 4 hours of walking at a leisurely pace. The entire trail is signposted and well maintained, so there is no risk of getting lost. Due to the weather, which is susceptible to rain and cold drafts, it is advisable to wear cold weather and waterproof clothing, as well as trekking shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        15 minutes from the city of Otavalo, in the parish of San Pablo del Lago, is the community of Araque, with its emblematic Rumi Park, which is the gateway to the ascent to the Warmi Imbabura in the Imbabura-Cubilche Volcanic Complex geosite. Araque corresponds to the largest commune of San Pablo del Lago, it is inhabited by people of the Kichwa Otavalo culture, the Kichwa language in Peru and Ecuador has undergone changes in their writing, being precisely the word Warmi an indicator of this; in the past Huarmi. For this reason during our visit to the community we will be able to see the use of both words.the route must be considered with a medium to high difficulty, which requires a good physical condition and the use of high mountain clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lagoon of Mojanda is another of the tourist attractions that the province has, this lake complex is conformed by a total of 3 lagoons, the biggest called "Caricocha" or Lagoon of Man the color of its water is intense blue and crystalline, then to about 3 Km approximately is the Lagoon called "Huarmicocha" or Lagoon of Woman and finally there is the smallest lagoon called "Yanacocha". To enjoy these lagoons and their surroundings the level of difficulty is easy to moderate, the roads are well marked and it is not complicated to reach all the lagoons. Also if you have time, you can make an ascent of Mount Fuya Fuya, although this requires a different level of preparation and a good physical condition. An important factor to take into account is the weather, it can change very quickly, so it is advisable to wear warm and waterproof clothing as it usually rains, you should have good shoes that are comfortable and with good grip.
